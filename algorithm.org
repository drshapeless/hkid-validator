#+TITLE: Algorithm

- A valid HKID should be 8 or 9 digits long.
- The first character of 8-digit HKID is an alphabet.
- The first and second characters of 9-digit HKID are alphabets.
- The following characters except for the last one in parenthesis are numbers.
- The last character, aka the check digit, is a number or 'A'.


* Validation of check digit.
For 8-digit HKID, prepend a space at front to make a 9-digit string.

For every digit, from left to right.

'A' = 10, 'B' = 11, ... , 'Z' = 35

Space ' ' = 36

Digit is its own value.

sum = 1st * 9, 2nd * 8, 3rd * 7, 4nd * 6, 5nd * 5, 6nd * 4, 7nd * 3, 8nd * 2

mod = sum % 11

If mod is 0, check digit is 0.

If mod is 1, check digit is 'A'.

If mod is 2-9, check digit is 11 - mod.
